# Zephyro's JavaScript notes

Hiya! Here I bring you my JavaScript notes. This repo will mostly be updated often, I'll be editing, deleting, updating files and that kind of stuff.

Also note that this won't have an _"order"_ like a list, it'll just be some folders with the README file with the notes about the specified topic.

I'll also post both english and spanish versions, both in their own folders.

You can always give me some feedback so can improve this, I'll appreciate it!

Oh, and I'd like to remind you that I have a [Blog](https://zephyrocode.github.io "Zephyro's Blog")!

So far, I've covered the following topics:

- Variables 
- Data Types
- Exceptions
- Classes
- Asynchrony
