# JavaScript Notes

Hiya! Here I bring you my JavaScript notes. This repo will mostly be updated often, I'll be editing, deleting, updating files and that kind of stuff.

Also note that this won't have an _"order"_ like a list, it'll just be some folders with the respective markdown file with the notes about the specified topic.

You can always give me some feedback so can improve this, I'll appreciate it!

Oh, and I'd like to remind you that I have a [Blog](https://zephyrocode.github.io "Zephyro's Blog")!
